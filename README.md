# Welcome to Plotify [a temp name] ðŸ‘‹


## What is this?

This is my attempt to build an iOS app from scratch, using a "low-code" approach.  I am building in VS Code, using Supabase, Expo, Gemini Assist, and using Github for version control

## What is the app?

The idea is to build a digital garden journal for the rising wave of tech-native millenials who are becoming interested in home gardens.

### TLDR
Plotify simplifies garden management by letting hobby and small-scale gardeners document their plants, organize garden beds, and track gardening tasks all in one place. With an elegant interface tailored for ease-of-use on mobile, Plotify functions as your digital garden journalâ€”making it easy to plan, document, and reflect on your growing journey. The app is designed for both new and experienced gardeners who want clarity, organization, and visual records of their efforts.

### User Goals
- Quickly add, tag, and visually log plants with photos and notes.
- Easily organize multiple garden beds and assign plants to their locations.
- Create, view, edit, and check off routine garden tasks (watering, transplanting, etc.).
- Maintain a clean, searchable digital journal/timeline of garden activity.
- Reference past entries to learn from successes and mistakes in the garden.
